        You should have gcloud installed and configured with a project by running:

            $> gcloud auth login
            $> gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]

        This script performs the following steps: 
        - builds the current golang package as a Docker container
        - Extracts the binary from the container
        - Uploads the new binary to an existing harness function which runs it in a new process

        The server must respect the port environment variable and not be hardcoded to Cloud Run's 8080
        This is because the dev harness runs it at 6060 and proxies 8080

        You need to set the environment variable:


            HARNESS_URL - the base URL of the harness
        
        This is most easily done with

            export HARNESS_URL=\$(gcloud alpha run services describe dev-harness --region us-central1 --format='value(status.address.url)')

example:

HARNESS_URL=https://dev-harness-azzzzzzz-uc.a.run.app ${name}
